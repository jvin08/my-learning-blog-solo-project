                    <h2>My starting point as a frontend student</h2>
                    <p>Learning is a journey that requires dedication and self-discipline. 
                        To stay committed, it's essential to set clear goals and define what I want 
                        to learn or achieve. I break my learning process into smaller, manageable 
                        steps, and follow a routine that fits my lifestyle.</p>

                    <h4>I stay motivated by finding my passion in a constant grow</h4>
                    <p>I seek out resources, such as blogs, courses, or mentors, 
                        that inspire and challenge me. Embracing failure is an opportunity 
                        to learn and grow, and I never stop asking questions. It really helps 
                        to surround yourself with a community of like-minded learners who can support 
                        and encourage me on my education.</p>
                        <h4>I started very slowly, doing very small steps but continuously.üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h4>
                    <p>Maintaining a growth mindset and nurturing my thrive on challenge, 
                        I'll be better equipped to stay committed to my lifelong learning journey.
                        Procrastination and overthinking can be stumbling blocks, but overcoming 
                        these obstacles by simply starting, taking the first step, and then 
                        consistently putting in the work is the obvious method to achive some results‚òùÔ∏è.</p>
